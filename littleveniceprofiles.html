  In the one year I’ve been on the canal I’ve realised that it’s not all smooth sailing, you must expect the unexpected. It’s all a great learning experience but you must be very organised. When all is going well, you just can’t beat boat life!

  We love living on a boat, especially with kids! My two-year-old think houses (and flushing toilets) are a real novelty. He loves boat moving day and wants to drive the boat ‘just like Daddy’. We enjoy exploring our new neighbourhoods: finding the best playgrounds and play centre, re-discovering our favourite little shops and restaurants, and visiting local attractions. It’s a bit like going on holiday every two weeks!

  I think a lot of people romanticise boat life, they think it’s going to be all smooth sailing. It’s important for them to understand what we really go through, however. I would implore those who want to try out the lifestyle to live on the canals by themselves for at least two weeks through the winter. You will see the complete truth of what it’s all about.

  The seasons play a big part in your life when living on a narrowboat. The summertime is lovely, things get a bit bleak in the winter though. When the weather starts getting colder, I normally just shut my door and go to bed!

  Almost nine years ago we got together and sold our house, to buy our narrow boat. This gave us the freedom to work in film and television without the pressure of the dreaded brown envelopes through the letterbox. In our experience as constant cruisers, we’ve found the majority of boaters very friendly and helpful without being nosey or clingy. Everyone values their privacy. Life is good afloat the boat that rocks.

  Living on the canals is a million miles different to living on land, it isn’t for everyone. It’s much more physically demanding, but the experience is freeing. I love being connected to nature, experiencing the seasons as they ‘come and go’ is grounding.
